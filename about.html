  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    My name is Muh'd-Bello Oluwaferanmi Abdul-Jamal, a student of Fountain
    University, Osogbo. I have a growing interest in technology and how software
    can be used to solve everyday problems.

  <h2>SIWES Experience</h2>
  <p>
    I completed my SIWES at HIIT PLC, Ikeja, where I was exposed to the practical
    side of software development. The training environment encouraged learning
    through practice and guided experimentation.

  <h2>Growth Over Time</h2>
  <p>
    At the beginning of my SIWES, my focus was mainly on understanding basic
    concepts. Over time, repeated practice helped me become more comfortable
    with structuring web pages, applying consistent styling, and introducing
    simple interactions using JavaScript.

  <h2>What I Gained</h2>
  <p>
    Beyond technical skills, the SIWES period helped me develop patience,
    problem-solving ability, and confidence in learning independently.
    These skills are essential for continuous improvement in software
    development.
